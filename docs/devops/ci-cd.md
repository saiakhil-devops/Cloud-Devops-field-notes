# CI/CD Practical Guide

## Why CI/CD?
- **Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)** are modern software engineering practices that ensure every code change is tested, integrated, and deployed quickly and safely.

- **CI (Continuous Integration)**: Detect bugs early by automatically building and testing on every commit.

- **CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment)**: Deploy stable code to production or staging environments with minimal manual intervention.

- **Value**: CI/CD reduces manual effort, prevents integration issues, increases developer productivity, and enables faster, more reliable releases.

---

## Key Concepts
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automates builds, runs tests, and integrates code changes frequently to catch issues early.  
- **Continuous Delivery (CD):** Keep code in a deployable state at all times; releases are a business decision.  
- **Continuous Deployment:** Fully automate production deployments once all checks pass.  
- **Pipelines as Code:** Define workflows (build ‚Üí test ‚Üí deploy) in version control using tools like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins.

## Minimum Viable Pipeline (GitHub Actions, Python)

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:

jobs:
  ci:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: "3.11"
      - name: Install deps
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt || true
          pip install black flake8 pytest bandit pip-audit
      - name: Format (Black) ‚Äì check only
        run: black --check .
      - name: Lint (Flake8)
        run: flake8 .
      - name: Unit tests (Pytest)
        run: pytest -q
      - name: Security ‚Äì Bandit (code)
        run: bandit -r .
      - name: Security ‚Äì pip-audit (deps)
        run: pip-audit
```

## Best Practices for CI/CD

- **Fail Fast**: Keep pipelines short and provide quick feedback.

- **Automated Testing**: Cover unit, integration, performance, and security tests.

- **Secrets Management**: Use GitHub Secrets, Vault, or cloud key stores ‚Äî never hardcode passwords.

- **Promote Environments**: Always test in staging before production.

- **Monitoring & Alerts**: Track build duration, test coverage, and pipeline success rates.

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them

| Pitfall                   | Problem                 | Solution                                        |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Long builds               | Wastes developer time   | Use caching & parallel jobs                     |
| Skipping infra validation | Broken deployments      | Validate IaC (`terraform validate`, `cfn-lint`) |
| Hardcoding secrets        | Security risks          | Store secrets in encrypted vaults               |
| No rollback strategy      | Production downtime     | Use blue/green or canary deployments            |
| Ignoring test automation  | More bugs in production | Automate tests early in the pipeline            |

## Advanced CI/CD Enhancements

- **Caching & Artifacts**: Speed up builds by caching Docker layers, pip/npm packages, or reusing artifacts.

- **Matrix Builds**: Test across multiple OS (Linux, Windows, Mac) or Python/Node versions.

- **Notifications**: Send alerts to Slack/Teams on success/failure.

- **Security Integration**: Run SAST/DAST tools (e.g., Trivy, SonarQube, Bandit, Snyk).

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Deploy infra automatically using Terraform, CloudFormation, or Ansible.

- **Progressive Delivery**: Use feature flags, canary deployments, and blue/green releases for safer rollouts.

---

**Blue/Green Deployment**

- **Two environments**: Blue (current) & Green (new).

- Traffic is switched from Blue ‚Üí Green once tests pass.

- **Benefit**: Zero-downtime deployments, quick rollback.

```

---

**Canary Deployment**

- **Gradual rollout**: A small % of traffic goes to the new version (Canary).

- Monitor performance & errors before full release.

- **Benefit**: Reduces risk of bad deployments.

```

---

**Rolling Deployment**

- **Step-by-step upgrade**: Replace old version pods (V1) with new ones (V2) gradually.

- No need for two full environments.

- **Benefit**: Smooth upgrades with controlled rollout speed.

    LB --> V2["Version 2 Pods (gradually increasing)"]
